  These course notes are addressed to a wide audience of people interested

  or simply in OCaml, whether they are programmers or language
  designers, beginners or knowledgeable readers —little prerequiresite is
  actually assumed.
  They provide a formal description of the operational semantics (evaluation)
  and statics semantics (type checking) of core ML and of several
  extensions starting from small variations on the core language to end
  up with the OCaml language including its object-oriented layer.

These course notes are addressed to a wide audience of people interested
in modern programming languages in general, ML-like languages in particular,
or simply in OCaml, whether they are programmers or language
designers, beginners or knowledgeable readers —little prerequiresite is
actually assumed.
They provide a formal description of the operational semantics (evaluation)
and statics semantics (type checking) of core ML and of several
extensions starting from small variations on the core language to end
up with the OCaml language —one of the most popular incarnation of
ML— including its object-oriented layer.
The tight connection between theory and practice is a constant goal:
formal definitions are often accompanied by OCaml programs:
an interpreter for the operational semantics and an algorithm for
type reconstruction are included. Conversely, some practical programming
situations taken from modular or object-oriented programming patterns are
considered, compared with one another, and explained in terms of typechecking problems.
Many exercises with different level of difficulties are proposed all along
the way, so that the reader can continuously checks his understanding and
trains his skills manipulating the new concepts; soon, he will feel invited
to select more advanced exercises and pursue the exploration deeper so
as to reach a stage where he can be left on his own.
